# Collaboration : Brothers adventure
This game is my submission to the Godot Wild Jam #24. The game made under 9 days with the help of some assets from Kenny (You will find links to that in itch.io page).
The jam theme was: Family. And I used 2 wildcards; Secret passage and Watchmaker.

The game it's 2d side scrolling puzzle platformer. When you play with 3 brothers with different abilities, and you should use the right brother to solve the puzzels and finish the level. The game it's a bit challenging.

This is the game page on itch.io:

The code source of the game it's not well organized. And the way I did things, it's not good or even bad solution. I just tried to solve the problems that I faced and make the things in my head for the game with the knowledge that I currently have for the engine with respect of the Jam limited time. So if you know better way to do things, I which that you commit I change to the repository so every one can benefit from it.
There is a lot of left none used code in the projects and some stuff that I made and didn't use (Like Dash).

I hope that you find the game enjoyable. Even if not, I hope you find somthing useful in the repository.
